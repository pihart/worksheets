# Atomic Radii

We often treat individual atoms as spherical entities.
While it isn't strictly true, this simplification provides motivation for studying chemical reactions using the notion of distance.

Recall that a sphere is uniquely defined by the length of its radius, the line segment from its center to any point on its boundary (see Figure\ \ref{fig:radius}).

![Two radii of a sphere are shown.
Note that they have the same length.\ \cite{Sphere_and_Ball}](images/Sphere_and_Ball.png){#fig:radius}

::: defboxed
When we treat an atom as a sphere, its _atomic radius_ is the radius of that sphere.

We already know that certain atoms have different "sizes."
The concept of atomic radii makes this precise:
different elements—and even different atoms of the same element—have different atomic radii.
